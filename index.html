                This section would describe how the page should look like. There would be a navigation bar like a sidebar,
                while every content div would looks like this one from OSX (Just for Design purposes - it's very clear and
                noticable for many users in the web). The content section would take about 80% of whole page width, while 
                sidebar (navbar) will be 20% wide. </br></br>

                Also: There will be some simple devnotes which would describe upcoming/latest updates. This website will be
                treaten as a mini-blog for my own development purposes. I would transform it into Webpack + Vue.JS + Node.JS 
                project in near future. Have a fun while reading this! </br></br>

                Content is wrapped into two sections to handle RWD more easily. </br></br>
